# openhouse.ai
  
A simple React Application to retrieve, compute, and display data from a RESTful endpoint.   
 
### json-mock-api:  
We can run this on localhost to emulate api calls.   
`npm i`   
`npx json-server --watch -p 3333 src/db.json`   
 
### openhouse-codingtest:   
The application displays all the communities in alphabetical order along with an image and the average price of all the homes associated with that community.   
`npm i `   
`npm run start`     

If given more time, I'll definitely clean the code a bit more. I would also like to add a search function, just so users can easily search for the community rather than trying to "find Waldo".
